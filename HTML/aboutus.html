                <h2>Billy Baney</h2>

                <p>Billy was known in his neighborhood to be an HTML phenomenom during MySpace's golden age. He quickly soaked up so much information online about web development that kids from all over his school were asking to pay him to design their myspace
                    Top 8! After accumulating a small fortune from this venture, he quickly realized that he might be able to make his hobby a very rewarding career as an adult and decided he would one day join Lambda School and become legend in Silicon
                    Valley!

                <h2>Marco Vargas</h2>

                <p>Marco's love for snowsculpting is rivaled only by his love for coding! Quickly and somewhat haphazardly abandoning the automobile-sales world, he immediately jumped into web-development much to the bewilderment of his friends and family.
                    With very little money in the bank, and so much to prove, the man has his eyes set on Google and his hands firmly planted against his $5 Goodwill Kensington keyboard (a steal if you ask me).

                <h3>Dad Jokes Project for Lambda School</h3>

                <p>We were tasked with building a marketing webpage for an application that will categorize the jokes you tell into Good 1's or Pop them off your arsenal as terrible jokes never to try again.</p>

                <p>We coordinated and decided to be each responsible for one page of the project. The About Us page was made by Marco Vargas, Home Page was built by Billy Baney. We both worked together on the Join Us page.
                </p>
